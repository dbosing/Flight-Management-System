# Flight-Management-System

A Flight Management program that provides the user a booking system to book a given flight using local database.
Using Windows Forms and C# as the main program. Also looking forward to implementing more features into this project.

To run the program, apply your own Database Server into the DatabaseHelper.cs file in the ConnectionString variable 
(i.e. "Server=EXAMPLE;Database=FlightManagementDB;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;";)
